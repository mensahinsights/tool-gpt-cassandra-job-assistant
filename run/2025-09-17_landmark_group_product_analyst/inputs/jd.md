About the job
Are you a data detective who loves turning numbers into narratives and insights into action? Do you get a thrill from uncovering the "why" behind business trends and using that knowledge to shape strategy?


We are looking for a sharp and driven Product Analyst to empower our teams with data-driven intelligence working at our HQ in Dubai, UAE.. In this role, you will be the cornerstone of decision-making, providing the analytical firepower that guides our product roadmap and business strategy. You'll go beyond reporting—you'll be a strategic partner, using data to identify opportunities, mitigate risks, and tell the story of where we should go next.


If you have a consultant's problem-solving skills and a passion for the product lifecycle, this is your opportunity to make a tangible impact.


What You'll Do:

Analyze complex datasets, core metrics, and business drivers to generate actionable insights that answer our most pressing questions.
Develop and maintain intuitive dashboards, reports, and analytical frameworks that empower teams across the company to make smarter, faster decisions.
Partner directly with Product Managers and business leaders to identify growth opportunities, potential risks, and areas for optimization.
Provide research and analysis on market trends and leverage AI-driven analytical techniques to keep us at the forefront of innovation.


Who You Are (Qualifications):

You have experience in a highly analytical role (e.g., Business Analyst, Data Analyst, Strategy Analyst) within a consulting firm, tech company, or product-led organization.
You possess a strong quantitative background and are proficient in SQL, Python, R, or other data analysis tools. Experience with data visualization platforms (e.g., Tableau, Looker, Power BI) is essential.
You are a structured problem-solver who breaks down complex, ambiguous problems into actionable steps—consulting experience is a major plus.
You take ownership of your work from start to finish, demonstrating accountability for your insights and their impact.
You have an enterprise mindset: you're resilient, proactive, and have the drive to "find a way" to get to the answer.


Ideal Backgrounds Include:

Former analysts from top-tier consulting firms with exposure to tech, data, or AI projects.
Analysts from product-first organizations (e.g., tech-enabled consumer companies, SaaS businesses) who are skilled at partnering with product teams.


Why Join Us?

Strategic Influence: Your analysis will directly inform key product and business decisions, giving you a front-row seat to our strategy.
Skill Growth: Hone your technical skills while developing deep business acumen and strategic thinking in a high-impact environment.
Collaborative Culture: Join a team that values curiosity, intellectual rigor, and data-driven debate.
