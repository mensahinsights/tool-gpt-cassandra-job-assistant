# Follow up after application, 70 to 90 words

I have applied for the [Role] and aligned my resume to the problems in the JD. My recent work reduced rework, sped up delivery, and improved confidence in KPIs. If helpful, I can share a short plan for the first 30, 60, and 90 days. Would a quick chat next week be useful?
