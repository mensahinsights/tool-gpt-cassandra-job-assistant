# Prompt‑Level Offset Examples

Bridge JD gaps by mapping to adjacent outcomes, scale, and stakeholder patterns. Keep language natural and outcome‑first.

## Tool gap
- JD asks for Tableau, candidate has Power BI → “Built adoption‑ready dashboards that lifted field compliance across regions, using a BI platform with row‑level security and usage tracking.”
- JD asks for Alteryx, candidate has Python + UiPath → “Automated data prep and audit summaries using Python scripts and attended bots, removing repetitive steps and errors.”

## Domain gap
- JD is healthcare, candidate has CPG → “Applied regulated‑data handling, cohort analysis, and demand forecasting patterns to patient‑journey style problems, focusing on accuracy and audit trails.”
- JD is fintech, candidate has government analytics → “Transferred controls, lineage, and reconciliation practices to meet reporting SLAs and reduce exceptions.”

## Seniority gap
- JD asks for ‘Lead’, candidate titles are ‘Analyst’ → “Led cross‑team adoption by coaching users, setting standards, and owning feedback cycles, resulting in consistent use and measurable lift.”

## Title mismatch
- JD uses ‘Insights Analyst’, CV shows ‘Transformation Analyst’ → “Reframed headline and summary to mirror the title while retaining transformation impact and automation outcomes.”

**Rule of thumb**  
For each gap, bind to, outcome, adjacent tool or method, stakeholder scale, proof (metric or frequency).
