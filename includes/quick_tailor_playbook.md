# Quick Tailor Playbook, Cassandra v3.1

Goal, increase daily applications without burning out. Use a three tier system and a minimum tailored output pack.

## Tiers, choose based on role priority
- **Bronze, 8 minutes**, headline, three line summary, three refreshed bullets, ATS coverage to 60 or more, submit. 
- **Silver, 15 minutes**, Bronze plus Core Skills refresh, one quantified proof swapped in, ATS to 70 or more.
- **Gold, 25 minutes**, Silver plus one page cover letter and one extra role bullet, ATS to 75 or more.

## Minimum tailored output pack, MTO
Use this when momentum matters more than perfection.
- Headline, mirror the JD title and bind it to one outcome.
- Three line summary, problems from the JD, domains, one number.
- Three bullets that bind methods to business results.
- One link check and filename standard.

## Bronze checklist, 8 minutes
1. Mirror the JD title in the Headline, add a value hook.
2. Paste two must have terms into your Summary, keep it natural.
3. Swap in three domain bullets from `includes/achievements/<domain>.md` and adjust nouns.
4. Run a quick spell and link check, export and submit.

## Silver checklist, 15 minutes
- Bronze plus, swap Core Skills to the domain overlay and add one quantified proof near the top.

## Gold checklist, 25 minutes
- Silver plus, generate the cover letter from `includes/cover_letter_hooks.md` and tighten one more role section.

## Notes
- If ATS coverage is below target and you cannot fit it in, add missing terms to Summary and one bullet only.
- Protect your week, do not exceed two Gold runs per day unless you have time clear.
