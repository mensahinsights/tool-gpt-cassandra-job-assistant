# Cover Letter Hooks and CTAs

Keep letters 180 to 220 words. One link only. One clear CTA.

## Ten first‑line hooks (≤ 20 words)
1. Your team is tackling the exact problems I solve, adoption, accuracy, and decisions that move KPIs. 
2. I build reporting that leaders use, not just dashboards that look pretty.
3. If outcomes beat outputs, we are aligned, I turn data into decisions that stick.
4. You want faster delivery and fewer errors, I specialise in exactly that. 
5. I help teams see, decide, and act, with measurable lift in weeks.
6. Your JD reads like my recent wins, compliance up, manual effort down. 
7. I focus on the moments that change behaviour, not vanity metrics. 
8. My work pays for itself, time saved, errors down, confidence up.
9. I ship usable analytics, designed with the people who rely on them.
10. I connect tools to outcomes so leaders move quicker with higher confidence.

## Ten CTAs (12 to 18 words)
1. Shall we schedule a 15 minute scoping chat next week to confirm fit and priorities?
2. I can share a quick demo this week, what times suit you?
3. If helpful, I will map your JD to my outcomes, may I send it?
4. Happy to meet your team for a short walkthrough, can we set a time?
5. I can outline a 30‑60‑90 plan in one page, should I send it?
6. May I propose a small pilot that proves value within two weeks?
7. If useful, I will annotate my resume against your JD, would that help?
8. I can provide references who saw these results first‑hand, shall I introduce them?
9. I will tailor a sample dashboard to your metrics, is that of interest?
10. Can we pick a slot to discuss your current bottlenecks and quick wins?
