# Metrics Redaction Patterns

When exact numbers are confidential, keep credibility by using safe ranges or relative deltas.

## Preferred patterns
- **Relative delta**: “reduced cycle time by one third,” “lifted accuracy by ~20 percent,” “cut rework by half.”
- **Ranges**: “raised compliance from the low 70s to the mid 90s,” “handled 150 to 200 locations,” “processed 300 plus datasets yearly.”
- **Scale words**: “nationwide rollout,” “multi‑region deployment,” “enterprise‑wide.”
- **Frequency**: “weekly audit summaries,” “daily ingestion,” “quarterly planning.”
- **Order of magnitude**: “seven‑figure impact,” “six‑figure portfolio,” when precise dollars are restricted.

## Do/avoid
- Do tie the metric to a business outcome, not just the number.
- Do keep the same tense and date style as the resume.
- Avoid vague claims without direction of change.
- Avoid stacking three or more metrics in one bullet.

## Safe rewrites (illustrative)
- Exact, “raised compliance from 69% to 95%” → Safe, “raised compliance from the high 60s to mid 90s.”
- Exact, “saved 10 hours per week” → Safe, “saved 10 plus hours weekly.”
- Exact, “deployed to 197 stores” → Safe, “deployed to nearly two hundred stores.”
