# ATS Terms Helper

Purpose, create a fast, deterministic way to hit the ATS keyword target without stuffing.

## 1) Extract terms from the JD
- Pull **unigrams and bigrams** from the JD (nouns and verbs, keep role, domain, platform, compliance words).
- Remove stopwords, keep industry terms and variants (eg, BI, business intelligence).

## 2) Build the target term set
- Tag terms as **must have** (role, core skills, domain) or **nice to have** (tools, methods, soft skills).
- Keep singular and plural where relevant, eg, dashboard, dashboards.

## 3) Place terms deliberately
- Require **must have** terms in **both** the **Summary** and **Experience** sections.
- Place **nice to have** terms where natural, avoid list dumps.

## 4) Score coverage
- Coverage = unique target terms that appear in the **Summary + Experience** divided by total **must have** terms.
- Target **75 percent or higher** to comfortably exceed the 70 percent threshold.
- If below target, add missing terms naturally by binding them to outcomes in bullets.

## 5) Micro checklist
- Role title mirrors JD phrasing.
- First 3 lines of Summary contain 2 to 4 must have terms.
- Each role has at least one bigram that matches the JD.
- No tables, icons, or text boxes.
