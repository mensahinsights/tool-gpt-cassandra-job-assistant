# Branch protection checklist

- [ ] Require pull request reviews (minimum 1)
- [ ] Dismiss stale approvals on new commits
- [ ] Require status checks to pass (QA workflow)
- [ ] Restrict pushes to `main` (maintainers only)
- [ ] Enforce for administrators
- [ ] Lock branch if needed during releases
